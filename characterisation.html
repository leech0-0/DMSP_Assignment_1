<p class="characterisation">Holdspaceâ€™s characterisation is minimalistic but stylised through its use of high contrast. The polygonal frame bouncing in conjunction with the soundscape shows a distinct connection between the two and entrances the users through the development of the interface. The prism going in the opposite direction as the polygonal frame gives the illusion of time being rewound, illuding to the progress bar rewinding and needing to hold the space bar for longer.

<p class="characterisation">Orb.farms interface can be described as playful. The pixel art is stylised and clean and there is a level of contrast between the background and the foreground, guiding the user to interact with the sphere in which they can create their environment. However, when the background changes to a night cycle, it can be difficult to see some of the elements, especially bacteria as it fades into a much deeper purple at night. </p>
