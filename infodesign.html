<p class="information_design"> Holdspace’s approach to information deign is solely through the progress bar positioned at the top of the screen, which encourages the user to continue holding the space key to listen to the soundscape further. This is an effective way to relay the remaining duration to the user without impeding too much on the main animations in the centre of the page. The interface is quite simple, with the only text (outside of the credits) introducing the concept of holding the space bar to play the soundscape.

<p class="information_design">In contrast, orb.farm is a lot more complex and requires a help document to explain all elements and how it can be used to create the farm. Orb.farm being designed as a sandbox encourages users to experiment, adapt and observe as time changes through this world, evident by the pixelated background reflecting a full day cycle as some elements are more active at night such as daphnia. . The computer initially showing up on the select screen can appear as confusing until the lips appear as well allowing the user to come to the conclusion that they are stickers on the orb. These stickers could have been placed in a separate section away from the base elements, or having a ‘sticker-peel’ in one of the corners so it can communicate more effectively that it is a sticker.</p>
