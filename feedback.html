    <h3>Feedback</h3>
<p class="feedback">The soundscape stopping and starting with the spacebar being held is also a good way to show the relationship between the space bar and the interface itself. However, this is not as strong as the visuals are, as the visuals have more contrast and the shape completely changes when the space bar is released. The audio crossfading with the polygon cutting to a prism is seamless and provides an illusion of ‘shutting down’, however with the audio in the soundscape stopping and starting frequently it could be slightly more confusing for the user to notice the feedback between the spacebar input and the interface. </p>
<p class="feedback">Orb.farm’s approach to providing feedback is effective through the various objects the user can include into their sandbox. The icons when selected change colour slightly and give the illusion of being ‘sunken in’ reflecting skeuomorphism of a button being pressed. This is easier to see for vibrant buttons such as bacteria, however for more muted buttons such as sand or stone it can be difficult to tell.</p>
